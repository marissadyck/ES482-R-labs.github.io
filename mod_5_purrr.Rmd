## What is Purrr

Often times you will want to apply the same **function** or multiple **functions** to multiple **objects** or inputs this is called **iteration**. In **Base R**, **iterations** are achieved by using **for-loops**, which are cumbersome and not very intuitive. If you've taken an R class before and covered **for-loops**, you are probably already nervous. But do not fear Tidyverse has made a package to conduct **iteration** operations that is much more user-friendly... and it has a cute inviting name, *Purrr*

Let's go through a few examples of how the *Purrr* package can be used

##Purrr map

As you can see from the [Purrr cheat sheet](cheatsheets/purrr_cheat_sheet.pdf), the *Purrr* package has a lot of usages. For the purposes of this course we will mostly focus on applying **functions** with *Purrr* (upper left).

To apply the same **function/s** to a number of **objects** we use the `map()` **function**. 

Let's go through an example WITHOUT using *Purrr* first and then apply the **tidyverse** alternative.
